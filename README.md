# MarkR

Markdown like converter written in C#. Right now it's very basic and it's "markdownish" with my own spin. 
I'll continue to update and add to it as I use it on my blog and other products.

Supports:

* Headers (#,##,###, etc.)
* Headers with Classes (##:blue Section One)
* Code Fences (GitHub Style ``` with class support)
* Links (\[Content\]\(link\ "Title"))
* Lists (Unordered(*))
