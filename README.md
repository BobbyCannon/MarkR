# MarkR

MarkR is a markdown converter forked from MarkedNet with some additional features inspired from many other projects.

#### Why MarkR?

I started working on MarkR originally to just learn more about markdown. My first attempt was to start from scratch but then 
my other projects started needing a real markdown parser. I decided to reset MarkR to start with MarkdownSharp then pivoted to
use MarkedNet instead. 

My focus is to continue to add more test and make the best parser I can. This is the same parser used in 
[Scribe](https://github.com/BobbyCannon/Scribe). 

If you find any issues please let me know so I can fix it. If you can please provide a markdown snippet showing the issue.
